# BACKLOG — open loops + ledger

**OPEN LOOPS is authoritative for "what's unfinished."** When HANDOFF
looks stale, trust this file. Ledger lines are append-only:
`YYYY-MM-DD | TAG | topic | one line` with tags
`[DECISION] [FACT] [DONE] [OPEN] [BLOCKER] [PREF]` and confidence
`[VERIFIED]/[STATED]/[INFERRED]` where a claim isn't ledger-backed.

## OPEN LOOPS (force-ranked)

**Active / near-term**
- [ ] Town-map expansion: fold Atlantic Highlands / Leonardo / Sea
      Bright street elevations into `docs/highlands_streets.json`
      (sweep + regen via `history/scripts/`; generator has town tags
      ready; rain view must stay Highlands-only).
- [ ] Nowcast scheduler: user chose ACCEPT-THE-GAP 2026-08-03.
      Revisit trigger: next event where the radar strip is dark
      during a rise, or when user has ~10 min for the external-cron
      + fine-grained-PAT option (options analyzed in the 2026-08-03
      HANDOFF-archive entry).
- [ ] Town map, staged features: bands/classic shading toggle;
      per-building doorsill tagging (user point-and-click, feeds
      freeboard); possible georeferenced user snapshot base layer.
- [ ] Antecedent wetting (model gap, user field insight 7/18): tank
      is memoryless about hillside priming; every double-pulse event
      is a calibration pair. Candidate: trailing-rain multiplier on
      K or two-layer soil reservoir. Related: duration-explicit
      V=C·(R−D)·T upgrade.
- [ ] Stateless-nowcast tank window: each run integrates from V=0
      over ~1 h of frames — understates once a burst ages out.
      Candidate: persist V with decay across runs. (Documented
      design; day-max memory partially compensates.)

**Parked (user-gated or seasonal)**
- [ ] Falling-tide stall experiment (user field task; drain coupling
      "breathing" first written up 7/13 tide event).
- [ ] Drainage-map email to Stephen Winters (user task).
- [ ] SMTP migration off current provider.
- [ ] Annual analytics refresh each January
      (`history/scripts/analyze.py` + `pull_sandy_hook_history.py`).
- [ ] Sandy-era rain archives hunt (extend anchor set backward).
- [ ] Porch riser tape-out (user offered): rebuilds vertical ladder
      above porch base.
- [ ] Datum line for widget + map-overlay chart (single chosen datum;
      deferred from the 2026-07-21 datums feature).
- [ ] forecast/flood_forecast_daily.py file split (seams documented
      in `forecast/README.md`; do after a quiet stretch, not
      mid-season).
- [ ] Choose/retire duplicated peaks charts after longer A/B (user
      single-user A/B since 7/07).

**Standing obligations**
- List `audits/` at session start; reply to open reports.
- Keep the living-documents registry (AGENTS.md) satisfied.

2026-08-03 | FACT | event-#6 | pluvial flood, peak +13.8″ ~10:33 ET, 5th of 6 measured; hindcast +13.4″; first live transactional-alert firing (3/3 channels) [VERIFIED: assets/observations/2026-08-03/]
2026-08-03 | DONE | retraction | "7/13 +19.5″ flood" never happened — all-hours QPE 0.00; removed from rankings; provenance rule added [VERIFIED: 2026-07-18 README retraction]
2026-08-03 | DECISION | 7/6-anchor | crest window [+15.0,+15.8], canonical +15.4 (window center); calibration unchanged [VERIFIED: model docs + event README]
2026-08-03 | DECISION | nowcast-scheduler | accept the cadence gap for now; revisit triggers recorded [STATED by user]
2026-08-03 | DECISION | alert-volume | daily cap 2 confirmed deliveries; warning-first texts [STATED by user; VERIFIED in tests]
2026-08-03 | DONE | town-map | Highlands street flood map shipped: LiDAR street elevations, band palette, scrubber, zoom/pan, OSM base layer, burst-aware rain view (Highlands-scoped) [VERIFIED: docs/highlands.html live]
2026-08-03 | DECISION | brain-migration | HANDOFF→short wholesale snapshot; AGENTS/BACKLOG/PLAYBOOK/audits split; old HANDOFF archived verbatim in attic/ [STATED by user; this commit]
