# BACKLOG — open loops + ledger

**OPEN LOOPS is authoritative for "what's unfinished."** When HANDOFF
looks stale, trust this file. Ledger lines are append-only:
`YYYY-MM-DD | TAG | topic | one line` with tags
`[DECISION] [FACT] [DONE] [OPEN] [BLOCKER] [PREF]` and confidence
`[VERIFIED]/[STATED]/[INFERRED]` where a claim isn't ledger-backed.

## OPEN LOOPS (force-ranked)

**Active / near-term**
- [ ] Town-map expansion: fold Atlantic Highlands / Leonardo / Sea
      Bright street elevations into `docs/highlands_streets.json`
      (sweep + regen via `history/scripts/`; generator has town tags
      ready; rain view must stay Highlands-only).
- [ ] Nowcast scheduler: user chose ACCEPT-THE-GAP 2026-08-03.
      Revisit trigger: next event where the radar strip is dark
      during a rise, or when user has ~10 min for the external-cron
      + fine-grained-PAT option (options analyzed in the 2026-08-03
      HANDOFF-archive entry).
- [ ] Town map, staged features: bands/classic shading toggle;
      per-building doorsill tagging (user point-and-click, feeds
      freeboard); possible georeferenced user snapshot base layer.
- [ ] Antecedent wetting (model gap, user field insight 7/18): tank
      is memoryless about hillside priming; every double-pulse event
      is a calibration pair. Candidate: trailing-rain multiplier on
      K or two-layer soil reservoir. Related: duration-explicit
      V=C·(R−D)·T upgrade. Priming is ONE of SIX structural insights
      queued as the next model session's menu — see "Model
      consequences" in assets/observations/2026-07-18/README.md.
- [ ] Stateless-nowcast tank window: each run integrates from V=0
      over ~1 h of frames — understates once a burst ages out.
      Candidate: persist V with decay across runs. (Documented
      design; day-max memory partially compensates.)

**Parked (user-gated or seasonal)**
- [ ] Falling-tide stall experiment (user field task; drain coupling
      "breathing" first written up 7/13 tide event).
- [ ] Drainage-map email to Stephen Winters (user task).
- [ ] SMTP migration off current provider.
- [ ] Annual analytics refresh each January
      (`history/scripts/analyze.py` + `pull_sandy_hook_history.py`).
- [ ] Sandy-era rain archives hunt (extend anchor set backward).
- [ ] PASSIVE COLLECTORS (opportunistic, when conditions occur):
      (a) verify enhancement holds at SH ≥ 7.5 ft (one multi-grate
      spot-check during a big tide); (b) cold-conditions events —
      each is a cold-lockout-hypothesis data point (advisory-only
      since 2026-05-19); (c) NWS surge-parser first-real-event
      validation — nws_surge_parser.py is live but has never seen a
      real coastal-flood product (all six measured events were rain).
- [ ] Confirm/deny 2025-08-21 flood (user saw swirly mud stains at
      August rental inspection — proto-mud-tracer): would add a row
      to data/labeled_events.csv. Low value; tide calibration no
      longer gates anything.
- [ ] Someday/speculative queue: attic archive §9 items 17–27 +
      §9e.4-adjacent (ETSS retry, NYHOPS, multi-town spin-offs,
      subscribe flow, iOS app stages, reanalysis, mesonet rain).
      Consciously move an item OUT of the attic to activate it.
- [ ] Datum line for widget + map-overlay chart (single chosen datum;
      deferred from the 2026-07-21 datums feature).
- [ ] forecast/flood_forecast_daily.py file split (seams documented
      in `forecast/README.md`; do after a quiet stretch, not
      mid-season).
- [ ] Choose/retire duplicated peaks charts after longer A/B (user
      single-user A/B since 7/07).

**Audit 2026-08-03-a2 remediation program (Codex full-repo audit;
all findings verified — see audits/2026-08-03-a2/)**
- [x] Phase 0: unify station-local day/time everywhere (21 naive
      now()/today() calls; injected clock + UTC-boundary/DST tests;
      TZ env as defense) — shipped `5332dd70`.
- [x] Phase 0: nowcast source-freshness semantics (source_latest_utc,
      age, frames expected/succeeded; site keys "live" off SOURCE
      time); 45-min hold labeled — shipped `5332dd70`.
- [x] Phase 0: heal_tree fail-closed for alert_state.json (quarantine
      + recover origin blob — it is transactional state now, not a
      cache); CSV-parse the predictions-log union; stop deleting
      unregenerated docs artifacts — shipped `5332dd70`.
- [x] Phase 1: CI triggers beyond forecast/tests (data/model/docs
      inputs); semantic gate checks (timestamps, enums, future-time
      rejection, freshness); dispatch-failure visibility + retry;
      pin actions/deps/CDN (SRI); _html_escape NWS feed text — shipped
      `5332dd70`; 67 tests + gate green, pending Claude review.
- [ ] Phase 2: repo-relative v0.10.1 refit/hindcast command +
      golden/physics tests (freeze behavior, no retuning);
      evidence-count prose precision (six anchors / two hydrographs /
      one recession constraint); move all_anchors recipe off the
      scratchpad import.
- [ ] corrects_row_id / erratum convention for append-only ledgers
      (first hand-written erratum row shipped 2026-08-03).
- [ ] Cadence SLO monitor (within accepted-risk posture). "BEST
      EFFORT" site wording shipped in `5332dd70`.
- [ ] Audit a2 closeout: Claude verify round-03 implementation diff;
      close only after findings/fixes are reconciled.

**Standing obligations**
- List `audits/` at session start; reply to open reports.
- Keep the living-documents registry (AGENTS.md) satisfied.
